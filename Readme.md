#AeroJS - A ridiculously lightweight MVC Framework

AeroJS is a super lightweight MVC framework written for those who want to enhance or add structure to an existing javascript app or who just wants to do clientside rendering without the hassle of a heavyweight framework. 

AeroJS only includes support for 4 things:

* Controllers
* Views
* Models
* Templates

With this in mind AeroJS can stay super lightweight and focused without becoming large and complicated like other frameworks. 

To get started clone the repo, include aerojs in your project and you're ready to go!
